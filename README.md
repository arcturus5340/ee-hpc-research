# EE-HPC Research

Exploratory and analytical workflows on ee-cpt generated CSV data.

## üîç Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and CSV datasets generated using the ee-cpt library. The focus is on analyzing performance and energy efficiency metrics from HPC applications, specifically:

- **ICON**: A global atmospheric model.
- **LULESH**: A proxy application for unstructured Lagrangian hydrodynamics.
- **NPB-MZ-LU**: A variant of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks focusing on LU decomposition.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `data/`: Raw CSV datasets generated via ee-cpt.
- `jube_configs/`: JUBE configuration files for running experiments.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for emulating POP metrics calculation from raw data.
- `results/`: Processed visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file :)

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
