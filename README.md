# ee-hpc-research

Exploratory and analytical workflows on ee-hpc generated CSV data for ICON, LULESH, and NPB-MZ-LU.

## üîç Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and CSV datasets generated using the ee-hpc library. The focus is on analyzing performance and energy efficiency metrics from high-performance computing (HPC) applications, specifically:

- **ICON**: A global atmospheric model.
- **LULESH**: A proxy application for unstructured Lagrangian hydrodynamics.
- **NPB-MZ-LU**: A variant of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks focusing on LU decomposition.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `data/`: Raw CSV datasets generated via ee-hpc.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `results/`: Processed outputs and visualizations.
